example of wc command
=========================
$ mkdir tst; cd tst ; touch {1..5}

$ ls | wc -l
5  # number of files in that directory

$ ls |wc
      5       5      10
      
NOTE: So here we have 5 "newlines", 5 words, and 10 characters. 
The 10 characters are the 1,2,3,4,5 and the corresponding \n 
(aka. newline character) that occurs after them in the output.

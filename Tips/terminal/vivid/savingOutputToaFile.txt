to save terminal output in a file
==================================
someCommand > someFile.txt      creates and overwrites
someCommand >> someFile.txt     appends
someCommand &> someFile.txt     also writes stderr
omeCommand &>> someFile.txt     apends stderr


using tee
==========

command | tee dirname/outputfile.txt          creates and overwrites
command 2>&1 | tee dirname/outputfile.txt     catches stderr
command |& tee dirname/outputfile.txt         prints output as well as saves


example:
clear; gfortran -o qn1 qn1.f95 && ./qn1 |& tee qn1.dat

to see difference between two files
====================================
1. install vim


2. vim -d file1 file2

  or vimdiff file1 file2
  
3. to quit type 
:wq!

==============================
method 2
man sdiff
sdiff -s file1 file2

===============================
method 3
cat file1    # we must sort before using comparing
cat file2
comm -23 <(sort file1) <(sort file2)


	comm compares (sorted) input files and by default 
	outputs three columns: lines that are unique to a, 
	lines that are unique to b, and lines that are present 
	in both. By specifying -1, -2 and/or -3 you can suppress 
	the corresponding output. Therefore comm -23 a b lists 
	only the entries that are unique to a.
	
==================================================
COMPARE TWO FOLDERS

diff -rq folder1 folder2

	This is a pretty simple command, with two command-line switches 
	(-rq). The r tells diff to look at each directory recursively, 
	including subdirectories. The q switch sets diff brief mode. 
	If we didnâ€™t set brief mode, diff would not only tell you 
	which files are different between the two folders, but also 
	show the actual line-by-line differences for any text files 
	that exist in both locations but are not identical

================
shows danger sign on top left corner and says something like this:
The update information is outdated.This may be caused by network 
problems or may be caused by a repository that is no longer available.
Please update manually by clicking this icon... 


1. when i click on show updates nothing happens.

solution:
=========
go dashboard and search "synaptic package manager"
(hit superkey)
go to settings>repository> updates   
click close,
we get errors:

i got many errors including these two:
1. Failed to fetch cdrom://Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS _Trusty Tahr_ -
2. ppa.launchpad....kile

then,
1. i uncheck settings>repositories   
then click Cdrom with Ubuntu 14.04 'Trusty Tahr' button
2. i unckeck settings>repositories> other softwares>  reload> then uncheck line with kile

3. close synaptic manager
4. go to warning flag, and click update all
5. the warning flag disappears.

to solve R program ppa <my.favorite.cran.mirror> (for ubuntu 15, wily)
====================================================
sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
then change:
        deb https://<my.favorite.cran.mirror>/bin/linux/ubuntu vivid/
to:
        deb https://<my.favorite.cran.mirror>/bin/linux/ubuntu wily/
restart the computer

I again got the error:
Failed to fetch https://<my.favorite.cran.mirror>/bin/linux/ubuntu/wily/Packages  Could not resolve host: <my.favorite.cran.mirror>

Then, I commented out that ppa

to give output of terminal to a text file
==========================================

example:

1. write the output (erases earlier contents)

echo "hello world" > temp.txt
echo "hello bob  " >> temp.txt  ( appends to it)

2. cat and grep command
cat = shows the whole text
grep "something_in_the_file" file_name
	= shows only those lines 
	
	example: we have a file sample.dat
kris, firefighter, east naples
jose, firefighter, east naples
john, driver, east naples
matt, lieutenant, east naples
frank, firefighter, north naples
tom, lieutenant, north naples
bob, driver, new york


we want to see all the firefighters
=====================================
grep "firefighter" sample.dat
grep "fire" sample.dat
grep "fire" sample.dat | sort -u

we want to only name of drivers
================================
grep "driver" sample.dat | cut -d\, -f1
		note: -d is delimiter and \, is comma
		note: f1 first word before comma,
			  f2 second word

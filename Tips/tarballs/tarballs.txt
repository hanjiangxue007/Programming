tar = Tape Archive
man tar

A: to create a tarball
======================
note: we can ignore compression by not

tar -cvf somthing.tar something
tar -cvzf somthing.tar.gz something

For example, to compress a directories jpg files only, youâ€™d type:
tar -cvf assign1.tar assign1

tar -cvzf jpegarchive.tar.gz /path/to/images/*.jpg


B: to unpack .tar.gz Archives
===============================
gunzip filename.tar.gz
then,
tar -xvf filename.tar





2. to unzip a tar file something.tar.gz
=======================================

tar -xvzf something.tar.gz


    f:  this must be the last flag of the command, and the 
        tar file must be immediately after. It tells tar the 
        name and path of the compressed file.
    z:  tells tar to decompress the archive using gzip
    x:  tar can collect files or extract them. x does the latter.
    v:  makes tar talk a lot. Verbose output shows you all the 
        files being extracted.

example2
==========
tar xf something.tar.gz

Note the lack of hyphen for the command flags. This is because 
most versions of tar allow both gnu and bsd style options 
(simplistically, gnu requires a hyphen, bsd doesn't).

example3
==========
to be extracted to a particular destination:
tar xf something.tar.gz -C /home/directory/

C : change directory

remote syncing example
=======================
1. create a folder in linux home directory
folder a 
       subfolder a contents: a.txt b.txt
       subfolder c contents: c.txt d.txt

soruce is : home/bhishan/a

2. lets say we want to copy this folder to BACKUP partion of hard drive
target is : /media/bhishan/BACKUP

3. then sync two folders
   rsync -azvu --progress /home/bhishan/a  /media/bhishan/BACKUP

4. note:
-a : archive mode, archive mode allows copying files
         recursively and it also preserves
         symbolic links, file permissions, user & group
         ownerships and timestamps
-v : verbose
-z : zip mode, compress file data
-u : update mode,if files that are newer on the receiver keeps it






# example
rsync -azvu ~/Google Drive  ~/Backups/

# crontab everyday at 12 noon
00 12 * * * rsync -azvu ~/Google Drive  ~/Backups/

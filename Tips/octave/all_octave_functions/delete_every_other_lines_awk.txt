delete every other lines
==============================

Remove every other line:
awk 'NR % 2 == 0' file > newfile
awk 'NR % 2 == 0' a.txt > aa.txt


Remove every 10th line:
awk 'NR % 10 != 0' file > newfile

The NR variable in awk is the line number.
Anything outside of { } in awk is a conditional,
and the default action is to print.
Whenever line number is a multiple of 2, print the line



You could possibly do it with sed, e.g.

sed -n -e 'p;N;d;' file # print every other line, starting with line 1
If you have GNU sed it's pretty easy

sed -n -e '0~10p' file # print every 10th line
sed -n -e '1~2p' file # print every other line starting with line 1
sed -n -e '0~2p' file # print every other line starting with line 2


sed -n -e 'p;N;d;' try.txt

non gnu sed or gnu sed
==========================
sed -n 'g;n;p' file


gnu sed
=========
seq 10 | sed '0~2d' # delete every 2nd line

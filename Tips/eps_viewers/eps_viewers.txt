To view eps file in MacOS
===========================

1. Preview.app   (in-built)
2. Skim          (free and simple app)
3. Inkspace      (free, can edit eps file, not simple)
4. Scribus       (free, can edit eps file, not simple)


Imagemagic - complicated to install, requires latest Xcode, also mac > 10.5

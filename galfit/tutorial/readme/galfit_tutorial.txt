Using galfit in unix
##======================================================================

1. to run a input file

galfit input_file_name
e.g. galfit galfit.feedme


2. Outputs:
galfit.01  # keeps increasing
fit.log    # keeps appending
imagblock.fits # from name given in input file

The image data cube has 3 lay-
ers: blahblah.fits[1], blahblah.fits[2], and blahblah.fits[3].
The first image is the postage stamp sized region speci-
fied in Item I (see below). Image [2] is the final model of
the galaxy in that region. Image [3] is the residual image
formed by subtracting [2] from [1]. Image [0] is blank.
The final parameters obtained in the fit are stored in
the FITS header of image [2]. If you are dumping the
final parameters into a table using a script, this is an
easier place to obtain them instead of trying to dissect
“fit.log.”

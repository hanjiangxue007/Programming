A simple script to draw a pendulum oscillating and record it to a
movie. This works on MacOSX but should be easily extensible to
Linux/Unix. It does not work on Microsoft Windows, because the
commands module (shell command line) does nothing, and some system
tools are not available in the form used here.

Additional details (and the resulting animated gif and QuickTime
movie) can be found at:

   http://www.uvm.edu/~kchu/?Page=VPython/index.html

Strategy:
--------

1.  Use VPython to make your animation.

2.  At every step in the animation (i.e. every re-rendering of
    objects) take a screenshot (/usr/sbin/screencapture) and save the
    file.

3.  Use Imagemagick to crop out the image of the VPython animation and
    turn it into an animated gif file or movie file (using QuickTime).

    - I manually position the VPython window in the top left-hand
      corner of the screen, and then let the animation run.

    - For the default VPython window settings, one can crop with a
      setting of 430x365+0+0.

Requirements:
------------
0. An Apple Macintosh running MacOSX (currently Panther or Jaguar)
1. Fink (fink.sf.net)
2. Imagmagick (install via fink: 'fink install imagemagick')
3. VPython (www.vpython.org)
4. QuickTime Player

Movie comments are denoted by ** movie **

Some physics: The actual differential equation,

d(dtheta/dt)/dt = -(g/L)sin(theta)

needs to be integrated.

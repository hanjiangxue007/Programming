#    Programming languages use either of the following 
#    specialized programs to translate code:

#    1. A Compiler - translates your entire code, then runs the program.
#    2. An Interpreter - translates and runs your code one instruction at a time

#    A scripting language is a programming language that uses an Interpreter to
#    translate its source code. The interpreter reads and executes each line of 
#    code one at a time, just like a SCRIPT for a play or an audition,
#    hence the the term "scripting language".

#    Python uses an interpreter to translate and run its code and that's
#     why it's called a scripting language




#    The main difference is in how they are used.

#    Scripts are typically quick and dirty.
#    Say, a bash script to make your life easier.
#    Whereas a 'programming' language is meant
#    to be much more thought out and deliberate.

#    That's not to say that you can't do that with a 'scripting' language.
#    You can make full-blown GUI applications (or web app) with python
#    as well as C++. The thing with 'programming' languages is
#    that they are usually faster, and offer more control over
#    low-level things if you want.

#    'programming' languages are typically used in scenarios where
#    the code will be around for a long time. If you want to write
#    something quickly and then never use it again,
#    'scripting' languages are what you want.

#    All of the above is of course subject to a person's expertise in
#    a given language. As long as a language is Turing Complete
#    you can do pretty much anything with it.
#    The only thing that controls what you can do
#    with it is libraries and how 'high level' the language
#    is (you can't malloc() in PHP).


#    Scripts can be run right after writing, executables
#    have to be compiled first.
#    Scripts need a separate environment
#    (such as Python or Bash) to run,
#    while executables only need the operating system.
#    Because of this, an executable can often be faster
#    than the equivalent script, and consumes less memory.
#    However, this is highly implementation dependent.
#    Scripts are usually cross-platform*, 
#    while executables generally work on a single platform.
#        
#    You can of course compile executables for several platforms separately
#    if your software doesn't depend on any platform specifics.

Hi, I am trying to learn multi-core programming in python.

This repository will hold all the tutorials starting from basics. 

If some one interested in learning them just follow and find
some tutrials that better teach you these programs.

I might try to add the source urls and the text books that 
better teach parallel programming techniques in python.

I might also try to put up some information regarding the
python libraries that can be used for multi-core programming.

For now (on or before 14-02-2014) take it for granted that 
the best multi-core processing library is "multiprocessing"
A process based threading interface.

# Imports




# The map, reduce, filter, and zip built-in functions are handy functions
# for processing sequences. These are related to functional programming languages.
# The idea is to take a small function you write and apply it to all the elements
# of a sequence. This saves you writing an explicit loop. The implicit loop within
# each of these functions may be faster than an explicit for or while loop.



# map ( function , sequence , [ sequence... ] ) â†’ list
# Create a new list from the results of applying the given function to the
# items of the given sequence . If more than one sequence is given, the function
# is called with multiple arguments, consisting of the corresponding item of
# each sequence. If any sequence is too short, None is used for missing value.
# If the function is None, map will create tuples from corresponding items in
# each list, much like the zip function.


val1 =  [a+1 for a in [1,2,3,4]]
print(val1)     # [2, 3, 4, 5]
val1 = list(map(lambda a, b: a+b, [1,2,3,4], (2,3,4,5)))
print(val1)     #[3, 5, 7, 9]
val1 = list(map(lambda a, b: a + b if b else a + 10, [1,2,3,4,5], (2,3,4,5)))
# the second iterable list is one item short
print(val1)                                   # [3, 5, 7, 9, 15]
val1 = map(None, [1,2,3,4,5], [1,2,3])
print(val1)     # [(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, None), (5, None)]



#=============================================

# reduce(function, sequence[, initial]) -> value

# Apply a function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of a sequence,
# from left to right, so as to reduce the sequence to a single value.
# For example, reduce(lambda x, y: x+y, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) calculates
# ((((1+2)+3)+4)+5).  If initial is present, it is placed before the items of
# the sequence in the calculation, and serves as a default when the sequence
# is empty.


val1 = reduce(lambda x, y: x+y, list(range(0,10)))
print(val1)     # 45 = 9*10/2
val1 = reduce(lambda x, y: x+y, list(range(0,10)), 100)
print(val1)     #   145 = 100 + 45


#=============================================
# filter(function or None, sequence) -> list, tuple, or string

# Return those items of sequence for which function(item) is true.
# If function is None, return the items that are true.
# If sequence is a tuple or string, return the same type, else return a list.



val1 = [d for d in 'abcd' if d != 'a']
# filter out letter 'a'
print(val1)     #  'bcd'


# not using lambda function, instead using a predefined function
def d(x):
    return True if x != 'a' else False

val1 = list(filter(d, 'abcd'))
print(val1)     #  'bcd'

#=============================================

# zip(seq1 [, seq2 [...]]) -> [(seq1[0], seq2[0] ...), (...)]

# Return a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the i-th element
# from each of the argument sequences.  The returned list is truncated
# in length to the length of the shortest argument sequence.


val1 = list(zip( list(range(5)), list(range(1,20,2)) ))

print(val1)     # [(0, 1), (1, 3), (2, 5), (3, 7), (4, 9)]

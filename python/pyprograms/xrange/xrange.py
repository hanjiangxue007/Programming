#    The xrange type is an immutable sequence which is commonly used for looping.
#    The advantage of the xrange type is that an xrange object will always take
#    the same amount of memory, no matter the size of the range it represents.
#    There are no consistent performance advantages.

#    XRange objects have very little behavior: they only support indexing,
#    iteration, and the len() function.

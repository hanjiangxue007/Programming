One should keep the following in mind when using \TeX
\begin{itemize}
\item \TeX\ is a typesetting language and not a word processor
\item \TeX\ is a program and and not an application
\item Theres is no meaning in comparing \TeX\ to a word processor, since the design
purposes are different
\item \TeX\ is the natural choice in one of these situations
\begin{itemize}
\item If we want to typeset a document containing lot of Mathematics
\item If we want our typed document to look beautiful
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Being a program, \TeX\ offers a high degree of flexibility.



\begin{enumerate}
\item prepare a source file with the extension "tex"
\item Compile it with \LaTeX to produce a "dvi" file
\item Print the document using a "dvi" driver
\end{enumerate}

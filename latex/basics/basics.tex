%	xdvi is an open-source computer program written by Paul Vojta for 
%	displaying TeX-produced .dvi files under the X Window System on Unix, 
%	including Linux. The xdvi interface has a set of GUI controls and a 
%	window displaying a single page of the DVI document.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%	LaTeX can organize, number, and index chapters and sections of document. 
%	There are up to 7 levels of depth for defining sections depending on the document class:
% 
%	-1 	\part{part}
%	0 	\chapter{chapter}
%	1 	\section{section}
%	2 	\subsection{subsection}
%	3 	\subsubsection{subsubsection}
%	4 	\paragraph{paragraph}
%	5 	\subparagraph{subparagraph}
%
%	\part and \chapter are only available in report and book document classes. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%	
%	To get an unnumbered chapter, section, sub-section, etc. add an asterisk 
%	before the opening curly brace. These will not go into the table of contents.

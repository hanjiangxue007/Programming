to open fit or fits file with ds9
==================================
source: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2032083

1) Install Ubuntu Tweak:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:tualatrix/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak

2) Open it up on the command line, $ ubuntu-tweak

3) Navigate to Admins > File Type Manager and click 'All'. 
	This may take a moment whilst it scans all your mimetypes.

4) Uncheck 'Only show filetypes with associated applications' at the bottom 
	(again, may take some time).

5) Click anywhere in the right-hand panel and start typing 'fits' to begin 
	searching for the 'FITS document' mimetype. Hopefully you should find it.

6) Double click it, and click 'Add' and then your custom command

 [N.B.: If you don't find the FITS mimetype listed, I would recommend installing
 GIMP as GIMP seems to have the FITS mimetype listed as a format it can open.
 You can also check the current mimetype of your .fits file by right-clicking
 it and selecting 'Properties' and then looking at 'Type'.]
 
7) Voila, now right click any fit or fits file, you can see ds9

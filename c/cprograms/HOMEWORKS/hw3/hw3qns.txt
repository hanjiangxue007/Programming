Develop .l (I program that .isks tor the user's height, weight and age (integer). and then
computes clothing sizes according to the l'mâ€˜muias:
o Hat Size a weight in potmtls divided by height in inches multiplied by 2.9
0 Jacket Size (chest in size) a height times weight divided by 288 and than adlusted
by adding 1/8 of an inch for each 10 years over age 30. (Note that adjustment only
takes place after a [all 10 years. So, there is no adjustment for ages 30 through 39, but
[/8 o/an inch is added [or age 40)
o Waist (in inches) = weight divided by 5.7 and then adjusted by adding 1/10 ofan
inch for each 2 years over age 28. (Note that the adjustment only takes place after a
full Zyears So, there is no adjustmentfor age 29. but 1/10 ofan inch is addedfor age
30)
Use functions for each calculation. Your program should allow the user to repeat this
calculation as often as the user wishes! That means. functions are invoked within a loop!
[2] Develop a C program that lets the user to choose one geometric object of his or her
choice and then initiates appropriate user interactions, computes and displays the Volume
and Surface Area as the output.

Write a program to do the following:
a. Display the table with appropriate labels for the rows and columns.

b.
 Compute and display the total number of votes received by each candi-
date and the percentage of the total votes cast.

c. If any one candidate received over 50 percent of the votes, the program
should display a message declaring that candidate the winner.

d. If no candidate received 50 percent of the votes, the program should dis-
play a message declaring a runoff between the two candidates receiving
the highest number of votes; the two candidates should be identified by
their letter names.

e. Run the program once with the data shown and once with candidate C
receiving only 108 votes in Precinct 4.
